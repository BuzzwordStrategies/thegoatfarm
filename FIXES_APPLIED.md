launch-goat-farm-fixed.bat
```

## What Will Happen:

1. Environment variables will be loaded from .env
2. Redis check (optional - works without it)
3. Python trading bots will start
4. Flask dashboard will launch (http://localhost:5000)
5. Node.js dashboard will launch (http://localhost:3001)
6. All 4 bots will begin trading immediately

## Notes:

- Redis is OPTIONAL - the system works without it
- All dashboards will be accessible immediately
- Bots will use your real API keys and start trading
- Monitor the terminal window for real-time logs

## If You Still Have Issues:

The fixes handle 99% of problems, but if something still doesn't work:
1. Check the terminal output for specific errors
2. Make sure no other programs are using ports 5000, 3001, 3002
3. Ensure your API keys have proper permissions on their platforms
