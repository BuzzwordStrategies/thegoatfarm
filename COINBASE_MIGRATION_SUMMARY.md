# Coinbase API Migration Summary

## Migration Completed Successfully! ðŸŽ‰

Your GOAT Farm crypto trading platform has been successfully migrated from the deprecated Coinbase Pro API to the new Coinbase Advanced Trade API.

## What Changed

### 1. **Authentication Method**
- **Before**: HMAC-based authentication using API Key, Secret, and Passphrase
- **After**: JWT-based authentication using Key Name and Private Key (ECDSA)

### 2. **Updated Files**
- `src/api/integrations/coinbase-client.js` - Completely rewritten with new API endpoints
- `env.example` - Updated with new environment variable requirements
- `src/utils/security/api-key-audit.js` - Updated validation for new key format
- `src/utils/security/api-key-manager.js` - Updated key mappings
- `src/api/api-manager.js` - Updated client initialization and health checks

### 3. **New Features Added**
- JWT token generation with ES256 signing
- Support for all Advanced Trade API endpoints
- Portfolio management capabilities
- Enhanced order configuration system
- WebSocket with JWT authentication
- Backward compatibility helpers for easier migration

### 4. **New Documentation**
- `docs/COINBASE_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md` - Comprehensive migration guide
- `scripts/setup-coinbase-keys.js` - Interactive setup script for new keys

## Next Steps

### 1. Get Your New API Keys
1. Visit [Coinbase Developer Platform](https://portal.cdp.coinbase.com/)
2. Create or retrieve your API keys
3. Note your Key Name (format: `8f68***6d3c`)
4. Download your Private Key

### 2. Configure Your Keys
Run the setup script:
```bash
node scripts/setup-coinbase-keys.js
```

Or manually add to your `.env` file:
```
COINBASE_KEY_NAME=your_key_name_here
COINBASE_PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here
```

### 3. Test the Connection
```bash
node src/utils/security/api-key-audit.js
```

### 4. Remove Old Keys
Once confirmed working, remove old keys from `.env`:
- COINBASE_API_KEY
- COINBASE_API_SECRET
- COINBASE_API_PASSPHRASE

## Key Benefits

1. **Enhanced Security**: JWT tokens expire after 2 minutes, reducing exposure
2. **Modern API**: Access to latest Coinbase features and endpoints
3. **Better Performance**: Improved rate limits and response times
4. **Future Proof**: The old API is being deprecated

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:
1. Ensure your private key is properly formatted (PEM or base64)
2. Verify your key has necessary permissions in Coinbase Developer Platform
3. Check the migration guide: `docs/COINBASE_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md`

## API Compatibility

The new client maintains compatibility with common operations:
- `getProductTicker()` - Works with new best bid/ask endpoint
- `getProductOrderBook()` - Mapped to new product book endpoint
- `getProduct24HrStats()` - Uses candles data for stats
- WebSocket subscriptions - Updated to use JWT auth

Your existing trading bots should continue to work with minimal changes!
